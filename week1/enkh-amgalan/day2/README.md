# git & github notes
# what we learned in today's task video 


Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes to files and collaborate with others on a project.


GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and offers features like issue tracking and pull requests.


To use Git, you start by creating a repository on your local machine, adding files to it, and then committing those changes to the repository with a message describing what you changed.
Git uses branching to allow you to work on multiple versions of a project at the same time without affecting the main branch.


You can push your changes from your local repository to a remote repository on GitHub using the command git push.
GitHub allows you to collaborate with others on a project by cloning their repository, making changes, and then submitting a pull request for them to review and merge.
